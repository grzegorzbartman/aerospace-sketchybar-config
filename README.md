## Additional Settings

### Mission Control Fix

Mission Control may display windows too small when AeroSpace places many windows in the bottom right corner. To fix this, enable "Group windows by application":

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock expose-group-apps -bool true && killall Dock
```

Or via System Settings: **Desktop & Dock â†’ Group windows by application**
